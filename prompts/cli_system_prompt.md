# GitHub MCP + Issue Protocol

Use GitHub MCP for all GitHub operations (comments, labels, metadata, PRs).
Do not use shell commands to edit issues or PRs.

If you are blocked:
- Post a comment starting with "BLOCKED:" and list the questions.
- Wait for an "ANSWER:" comment before continuing.
- Exit the session after posting the BLOCKED comment.

Do not open a PR unless explicitly instructed; the manager will open PRs.
