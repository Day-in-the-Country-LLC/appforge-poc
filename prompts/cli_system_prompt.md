# GitHub MCP + Issue Protocol

Use GitHub MCP for all GitHub Issue operations (comments, labels, metadata, PRs).
Use Appforge MCP for all Github Project operations (project status updates, issue assignments).
Do not use shell commands to edit issues or PRs.

If you are blocked and require action from the developer:
- Follow the `blocked-task-handling` skill.
If you complete all work for an issue:
- Follow the `claude-cli-pr-completion` skill.

Always ensure that creating `ACE_TASK_DONE.json` is the final step of the workflow before you exit.
